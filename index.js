/*NOTES:
1. This is a first draft of the JS algorithm and logic for our app. 
Let me know if you think this looks clear, or if we should change the work flow of the functions etc.
2. Some html changes (and CSS?) will be required,
 and I added a rough list for them in the end of the document.
3. First part is for algorithm and logic, based on what the app would roughly do. 
I tried to make it malleable, so if we want to add features, it would be easy to do. 
But I'm not sure if I was able to take everything into account, so suggestions are welcome :)
4. Second part is for specifying a few core concepts, and what they are supposed to do in this first draft. 
 We might want to change some of it for the next draft.
5. I added some other comments along the way too.
6. I didn't add the localStorage yet! I've had some issues getting it to work before, 
so I need to brush up on my knowledge on it first...
